    "dialogue.\n",
    " Safety & Policy Enforcement: The system must use the provided Medicine\n",
    "Excel Sheet as its \"Source of Truth.\" It must autonomously decide if an order can\n",
    "proceed based on stock levels and \"Prescription Required\" flags.\n",
    " Predictive Intelligence: The system must be \"Proactive.\" Based on the\n",
    "Mock Customer History, it should identify which users are running out of\n",
    "medicine and initiate a refill conversation or alert\n",
    " Real-world Action (Tool Use): The system shouldn't just \"talk.\" It must execute\n",
    "actions such as updating your mock database, triggering webhooks (mock\n",
    "webhooks or n8n/Zapier), or sending order confirmations via channels like email,\n",

    "patients, including what they bought, the date of purchase, and the dosage\n",
    "frequency.\n",
    "B. Mock Backend\n",
    " No CMS provided: You must build a mock API/Backend (FastAPI, Node.js, Supabase,\n",
    "etc.) to host the provided data.\n",
    " Your agents must interact with this backend to read inventory, check user history,\n",
    "and write new orders.\n",
    "C. Observability (Mandatory)\n",
    "Since this is an agentic system, traceability is non-negotiable.\n",
    " You must integrate an observability platform (e.g., Langfuse, LangSmith).\n",
    " The judges must be able to see the Chain of Thought (CoT): How Agent A talked to\n",
    "Agent B, and why Agent B approved/rejected a request.\n",
    " Submissions without a live Trace Log link will be disqualified.\n",
    "D. Minimal UI\n",
    " A simple UI is enough but can be enhanced to show the features\n",
    " It must include a Chat-based interface and Voice capability is a high-value priority\n",
    " A small \"Admin View\" showing the Mock Inventory levels and any \"Proactive Refill\"\n",
