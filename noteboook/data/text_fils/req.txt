Core Functional Requirements
Your system will be judged on its ability to handle these Agentic Capabilities:
 Conversational Ordering: A natural interface (text-based and voice-based) that
can extract medicine names, dosages, and quantities from messy, human like
dialogue.
 Safety & Policy Enforcement: The system must use the provided Medicine
Excel Sheet as its "Source of Truth." It must autonomously decide if an order can
proceed based on stock levels and "Prescription Required" flags.
 Predictive Intelligence: The system must be "Proactive." Based on the
Mock Customer History, it should identify which users are running out of
medicine and initiate a refill conversation or alert
 Real-world Action (Tool Use): The system shouldn't just "talk." It must execute
actions such as updating your mock database, triggering webhooks (mock
webhooks or n8n/Zapier), or sending order confirmations via channels like email,
WhatsApp
Data & Environment
A. Data Assets
1. 2. Medicine Master Data (Excel/CSV): Contains a list of medicines, current
stock levels, unit types, and "Prescription Required" flags.
Consumer Order History (Excel/CSV): Contains historical data for a set of
patients, including what they bought, the date of purchase, and the dosage
frequency.
B. Mock Backend
 No CMS provided: You must build a mock API/Backend (FastAPI, Node.js, Supabase,
etc.) to host the provided data.
 Your agents must interact with this backend to read inventory, check user history,
and write new orders.
C. Observability (Mandatory)
Since this is an agentic system, traceability is non-negotiable.
 You must integrate an observability platform (e.g., Langfuse, LangSmith).
 The judges must be able to see the Chain of Thought (CoT): How Agent A talked to
Agent B, and why Agent B approved/rejected a request.
 Submissions without a live Trace Log link will be disqualified.
D. Minimal UI
 A simple UI is enough but can be enhanced to show the features
 It must include a Chat-based interface and Voice capability is a high-value priority
 A small "Admin View" showing the Mock Inventory levels and any "Proactive Refill"
alerts the system has generated.
E. Workflow Automation
 Show a real-world When an order is finalized, your agent must trigger a warehouse
fulfillment request via a mock Webhook or API. (Optional Bonus: Automate confirmation
emails or WhatsApp messages).
E. Submission Checklist
 GitHub Repo: Clean code and a README for your Mock APIs.
 Observability Public Link: Access to view your agentic trace logs.
