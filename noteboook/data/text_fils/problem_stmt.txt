You have to build an Agentic AI System that transforms a traditional search-and-
click pharmacy into an autonomous ecosystem. The system should behave like
an expert pharmacist, understand natural voice/text conversations, predict medicine
refill needs, enforce safety and prescription rules, and autonomously execute
backend tasks such as inventory updates and procurement—with minimal human
intervention.
